This documentation focuses on the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/307690" target="_blank">Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</a> and primarily targets the <a href="https://github.com/SDmodding/TheoryEngine" target="_blank">Theory Engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SDmodding/SDK" target="_blank">SDK (dev-kit plugin)</a>.

In addition, this documentation may be valuable for other games utilizing the same engine:
* **ModNation Racers** – the first known game to use this engine
* **LittleBigPlanet Karting**
* **Sleeping Dogs**
* **Triad Wars** – a slightly newer version, but almost identical

Please note that most information in this documentation may not be fully accurate for other games, as their builds differ by several years.
