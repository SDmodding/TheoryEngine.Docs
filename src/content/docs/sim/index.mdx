title: Overview
---

The `Simulation` class manages all `SimObject` instances in the game. It provides functions to create, destroy, and track simulation objects.

## Members

| Members | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [mSimObjects](#msimobjects) | Stores all active simulation objects. |
| [mSimObjectsToBeDeleted](#msimobjectstobedeleted) | Stores objects queued for deletion. |
| [mSimObjectsToBeDeletedRecursively](#msimobjectstobedeletedrecursively) | Stores objects queued for recursive deletion. |
| [mpLocalPlayer](#mplocalplayer) | A safe pointer to the local player object. |
| [m_aCurrentDestructingObjects](#macurrentdestructingobjects) | Stores currently destructing objects. |

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| [Instance](#instance) | Returns the singleton instance of the `Simulation` class. |
| [CreateSimObject](#createsimobject) | Creates a new simulation object with the specified name. |
| [DestroyAllSimObjects](#destroyallsimobjects) | Destroys all active simulation objects. |
| [DestroyQueuedSimObjects](#destroyqueuedsimobjects) | Destroys all simulation objects that have been queued for deletion. |
| [DestroySimComponent](#destroysimcomponent) | Destroys a specific simulation component. |
| [DestroySimObject](#destroysimobject) | Destroys a specific simulation object. |
| [GenerateUniqueName](#generateuniquename) | Generates a unique name based on the provided root symbol. |
| [GenerateUniqueName](#generateuniquename) | Generates a unique name based on the provided root string. |
| [GetSimObject](#getsimobject) | Retrieves a simulation object by its `qSymbol` name. |
| [GetSimObject](#getsimobject) | Retrieves a simulation object by its `u32` unique identifier. |
| [QueueSimObjectToBeDestroyed](#queuesimobjecttobedestroyed) | Queues a simulation object for deletion. |
| [QueueSimObjectToBeDestroyedRecursive](#queuesimobjecttobedestroyedrecursive) | Queues a simulation object for recursive deletion. |
| [QueueTrackedSimObjectToBeDestroyed](#queuetrackedsimobjecttobedestroyed) | Queues a tracked simulation object for deletion. |
| [TrackSimObject](#tracksimobject) | Tracks a simulation object. |
| [UntrackSimObject](#untracksimobject) | Stops tracking a simulation object and returns whether the untracking was successful. |

## Notes
- This class is primarily used to manage game entities dynamically.
- It provides an efficient way to handle object creation, tracking, and destruction within a simulated environment.
