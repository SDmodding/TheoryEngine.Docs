The user interface utilizes the **Scaleform GFx 4.3.27** library as its rendering engine.

- Scaleform GFx-related functionality is mainly managed by the `UIScreen` classes.
- The `UIScreenChunk` is the main resource file that contains the Scaleform GFx file, which was successfully created from scratch by modifying an SWF file exported from Adobe Flash Professional CS6.
